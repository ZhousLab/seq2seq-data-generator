Water vapor is an essential climate variable as it provides the basis for all cloud formation, cloud physics and furthermore influences the Earth's heat budget due to its high absorbance of long and short-wave radiation. Total column water vapor is a measure of the integrated water vapor content of the atmosphere.

This dataset uses total column water(TCW) data collected near Singapore (1.5N, 104E) from past 42 years to conduct univariable sequence-to-sequence prediction task. The aim is to predict future trend of TCW.
